# Introduction to Parallel Programming using MPI

These are exercises to run along with the tutorial. 
Solutions are provided for each exercise.

## Building
    --------

To build, simply run
make 


## Run
   ---
- Copy jobscript_template.slurm from top level directory to your activity direcotry
- Modify the srun line to add your application name you built using make.
- To submit to slurm scheduler, use 
	sbatch jobscript_name
- An output file namely slurm-XXXXXX.out will be created in your present working directory. You can examine it with 
	cat slurm-XXXXX.out

- Conditions to adhere while running activity 6:
	N should be exactly divisible by sqrt(nprocs) where N is Number of grid points in 1 dimension
	nprocs should be a perfect square i.e. is a whole number e.g. 1,4,9,16 etc..
